# InstaCart-Marketing-Optimization

This report seeks to explore the trends in customer purchasing behavior on the Instacart online grocery shopping platform. Through exploratory data analysis of when customers shop, what products they order and reorder, and from which departments they shop most frequently, we conclude that Instacart's strengths are as a grocery distributor that offers fresh, perishable products in a convenient, time-efficient manner. Instacart's best practice is to recommend products similar to those which a user has already purchased, and to target users for new product recommendations only after they have their routine items in their virtual cart. We look further into users' interaction with organic and non-organic products and make the recommendation that Instacart expand its organic selection based on interest in the departments where organic products are prevelant, although further analysis would need to be done to explore profitability of organic groceries as a strategy.
